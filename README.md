# Contactless_Covid_Tester_Web_App

A simple Web App integrated with AI systems is implemented which helps the Doctor to diagnose the patients without visiting them.
The Web App contains two major things

Contactless Test
Chatbot
The Web App records the inputs from the user and the AI system generates the test values which finally produces a base score and is then recorded into the database. Similarly 'n' number of patients can access the Web App staying at home. The base score is generated for all the patients. The App prioritizes the patients based on the base score. Higher the base score , higher is the importance given to that patient. The Doctors login the Web App and diagnose the patients as prioritized. The Doctor gives a voice based prescription which is then converted into proper prescription format(pdf) and is sent to the patient's mail. If the Doctor feels that a patient is really in need of a COVID test , only then it is suggested. Otherwise people can follow the guidelines as prescribed by the Doctor in the prescription. This Web App ensures that people can be diagnosed by just staying at home. In order to reduce fear and increase mental stability of the user, an interactive AI chatbot is bult which acts as a Doctor as well as a counselor. The user can post all his doubts and queries regarding COVID-19 and also how he/she feels about it. The Chatbot is entirely positive and supports the user in order to fight the Corona virus.
