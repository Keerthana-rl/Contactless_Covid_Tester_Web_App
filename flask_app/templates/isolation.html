    Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.
<br>
    Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
<br>
    If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:

    -  If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention),<br>
    have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities <br>
    If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart<br>
    Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members<br>
    Monitor your symptoms daily<br>
    Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy<br>
    If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately – call them first if possible<br>
    Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.<br>
