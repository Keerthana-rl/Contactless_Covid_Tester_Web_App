                It's good that you are maintaining a good fat content in the body, please maintain it. Consume unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, olive oil, soy, canola, sunflower and corn oils) rather than saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oils, cream, cheese, ghee and lard).
                You are maintaining a bad level of magnesium, please consume more leafy greens ,legumes etc..,
                Your Zinc content is well bad. Please improve eating seeds, nuts, cashews.<br><br>

                <h2>LIMIT THE SUGAR CONTENT</h2>
                You are maintaining a good content. If you crave something sweet,
                fresh fruit should always be the priority. Frozen fruits, canned
                fruits in juice rather than syrup, and dried fruits with no added sugar are also
                 good options. Its really easy to follow a diet plan. Surely
                 nothing is greater than will power.<br><br>

                <h2>LIMIT YOUR SALT INTAKE</h2>
                WHO recommends consuming less than 5 g of salt per day. In order to achieve this,
                prioritize foods with reduced or no added salt. You may also consider rinsing canned
                foods such as vegetables and beans, to remove some of the excess sodium.<br><br>

                    <h2> STAY HYDRATED</h2>
                You are maintaining a good hydration level. Maintain the same. Water is essential for life. It transports nutrients and compounds in blood, regulates your body temperature, gets rid of waste, and lubricates and cushions joints.
                Also eat fruits like cucumber, citrus fruits which have good water content.<br><br>

                 sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).<br><br>

                •	Need to consume more green veggies like spinach, coriander etc..,<br><br>

                •	Say no to Alcohol, as it makes the mind unsteady and Alcohol also
                makes certain medications less effective, while increasing
                the potency and toxicity of others. <br><br>
