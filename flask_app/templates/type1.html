                    Your Magnesium content is well good.
                </div> Please maintain eating legumes,
                nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and whole grains.
                It's good that you are maintaining a good fat content in the body, please
                maintain it. Consume unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts,
                olive oil, soy, canola, sunflower and corn oils) rather than saturated fats
                (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oils, cream, cheese,
                ghee and lard).
                Also eat fruits like cucumber, citrus fruits which have good water content.<br>
                per day, at least 8 glasses.<br>

                <h2>LIMIT THE SUGAR CONTENT</h2>
                You are maintaining a better sugar content in the body. Please follow it. If
                you crave something sweet, fresh fruit should always be the priority.
                Frozen fruits, canned fruits in juice rather than syrup, and dried fruits
                with no added sugar are also good options.

                <h2>LIMIT YOUR SALT INTAKE</h2>
                WHO recommends consuming less than 5 g of salt per day. In order to
                achieve this, prioritize foods with reduced or no added salt. You may also
                consider rinsing canned foods such as vegetables and beans, to remove
                some of the excess sodium.
                 <h2>STAY HYDRATED</h2>
                You are maintaining a bad hydration level. Please consume more water
                per day, at least 8 glasses.<br>

                • Eat 2-3 cups of vegetables<br><br>
                • Do not overcook vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of
                important vitamins.<br><br>

                • Maintain eating leafy greens and other fresh fruits.<br><br>
                • Avoid industrially produced trans fats. These are often found in
                processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies,
                cookies, margarines and spreads.<br><br>
                • Avoid processed meats because they are high in fat and salt.<br><br>
                • Consume handful of nuts like cashew, almonds etc..,<br><br>
                • Say no to Alcohol, as it makes the mind unsteady and Alcohol also
                makes certain medications less effective, while increasing the
                potency and toxicity of others.
